### Template 1: Initial Outreach
**Subject**: Free directory listing for [City] premarital counselors

Hi [First Name],

I found your practice while researching premarital counseling services in [City]. Your approach to [specific service/specialty] really stood out.

I run Wedding Counselors (weddingcounselors.com) - a directory helping couples find quality premarital counseling. I'd like to offer you a completely free listing that includes:

✓ Professional profile with your bio & services
✓ Direct link to your website (great for SEO)
✓ No fees, contracts, or hidden costs

Many counselors see increased referrals within weeks of joining. Would you be interested in a free listing?

I can set this up in under 10 minutes if you'd like.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Hi [First Name],

I reached out last week about a free listing on our premarital counseling directory. 

Since launching, we've helped hundreds of counselors increase their online visibility and client referrals at zero cost.

The setup takes just a few minutes, and there's genuinely no catch - we believe quality counselors should be easy for couples to find.

If you're interested, just reply and I'll get you set up today.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Template 3: Value-Add Follow-Up (14 days later)
**Subject**: Local SEO tip for premarital counselors

Hi [First Name],

Since you're focused on premarital counseling in [City], here's a quick tip that's working well for other counselors:

Creating location-specific content (like "[City] couples often ask about...") significantly improves local search rankings.

Our directory listing would complement this strategy perfectly with a high-authority backlink to your site.

Still interested in that free listing? Just let me know.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - This is my final outreach. Reply "unsubscribe" if you'd prefer no future contact.
