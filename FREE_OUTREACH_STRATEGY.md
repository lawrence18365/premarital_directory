# Free Outreach Strategy - Get Counselors to Claim Their Profiles

**Problem:** You have no money for email tools and counselors don't reply to cold emails.

**Solution:** Use FREE methods that actually work + better messaging.

---

## 🎯 Strategy 1: LinkedIn Outreach (FREE & EFFECTIVE)

### Why LinkedIn Works:
- ✅ Counselors check LinkedIn regularly (unlike random emails)
- ✅ You can see if they've read your message
- ✅ More personal than cold email
- ✅ 100% free with basic account

### How to Do It:

**Step 1: Find Counselors on LinkedIn**
Search: `"marriage therapist" OR "premarital counseling" OR "couples therapist" + [City]`

Example: `"marriage therapist" Louisville Kentucky`

**Step 2: Send Connection Request (FREE)**
Add a note:
```
Hi [Name], I noticed your practice in Louisville. I run WeddingCounselors.com,
a free directory helping engaged couples find premarital counseling. We'd love
to feature you - no cost involved. Mind if I share how it works?
```

**Step 3: Once Connected, Send This:**
```
Thanks for connecting! Quick heads up - I've added your practice to
WeddingCounselors.com (a free directory for premarital counselors).

Engaged couples in Louisville can now find you at:
[YOUR_PROFILE_URL]

You can claim this listing for free to:
- Get email notifications when couples contact you
- Update your bio and specialties
- Add your credentials and experience

Just takes 2 minutes: [CLAIM_URL]

No cost, no commitment. Just helping couples find you!

P.S. If you'd prefer I remove the listing, just let me know.
```

**Why This Works:**
- You've ALREADY given them value (free listing)
- They have an incentive to claim it (control their info)
- The "remove it" option shows you're not spammy
- LinkedIn feels more professional than random email

---

## 🎯 Strategy 2: Facebook Groups (FREE)

### Find Therapist Groups:
1. Go to Facebook Groups
2. Search for:
   - "Therapists in [State]"
   - "Marriage and Family Therapists"
   - "Licensed Counselors Network"
   - "Private Practice Therapists"

### Post This (DON'T DM - Post Publicly):
```
🎉 FREE Resource for Premarital Counselors

I built WeddingCounselors.com - a free directory connecting engaged
couples with premarital counselors.

If you offer premarital counseling, you can:
✅ Get a free listing (already SEO optimized)
✅ Receive lead notifications from local couples
✅ No fees, no contracts, no catch

Kentucky therapists: I've already added several practices and couples
are finding them through Google.

Claim your free profile: https://www.weddingcounselors.com

Would love feedback from this community!
```

**Why This Works:**
- Peer recommendation (not cold outreach)
- You're offering value, not selling
- They can see others are already listed
- Social proof in their trusted community

---

## 🎯 Strategy 3: Google My Business Comments (FREE & GENIUS)

### How to Do It:

**Step 1:** Find counselor's Google Business Profile
- Google: "[Counselor Name] Louisville KY"
- Click on their GMB listing

**Step 2:** Leave a helpful review/comment:
```
Great to see premarital counseling options in Louisville! I recently
added your practice to WeddingCounselors.com (a free directory for
couples seeking premarital counseling). If you'd like to claim your
listing and manage how you appear, visit [CLAIM_URL]. Keep up the
great work helping couples!
```

**Why This Works:**
- They get a notification
- It's public (social proof)
- Shows you're legitimate
- Not asking for anything

---

## 🎯 Strategy 4: Fix Your Email Template

### Your Current Email (Probably Sounds Like This):
```
❌ "Hi, we have a directory. Claim your profile."
```
**Problem:** Sounds like spam. No value stated. Asking for their time.

### Better Email Template (FREE Gmail):
```
Subject: Your practice is listed on WeddingCounselors.com

Hi [Name],

Quick heads up - I added your practice to WeddingCounselors.com,
a free directory that helps engaged couples in Louisville find
premarital counseling.

Your listing is already live here:
https://www.weddingcounselors.com/premarital-counseling/kentucky/louisville/[their-name]

Couples are searching on Google and finding counselors like you
through the directory (over 200 searches last month in Kentucky).

You can claim this FREE listing to:
• Get notified when couples contact you
• Update your bio, credentials, and specialties
• Add your photo and contact preferences

Takes 2 minutes: [CLAIM_LINK]

If you'd prefer I remove your listing, just reply and I'll take
it down immediately.

Best,
[Your Name]
WeddingCounselors.com

P.S. No cost ever. I built this to help couples find quality
premarital counseling, and therapists get more visibility. Win-win.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Lead with value (they're already listed)
- Show social proof (200 searches)
- Give them control (can remove it)
- Clear benefit (free leads)
- Personal, not templated feel

---

## 🎯 Strategy 5: Psychology Today Outreach (FREE)

### How:
1. Go to PsychologyToday.com
2. Search for marriage/couples therapists in your target cities
3. Use their contact forms (free)
4. Send this message:

```

Hi [Name],

- Specific niche (premarital vs general therapy)

## 🎯 Strategy 6: Use Your Claim Profile Page Strategically

## 🎯 Strategy 7: Partner with Wedding Vendors (FREE)

### Reach Out To:
- Wedding planners
- Venues
- Photographers
- Churches

### Message Template:
```
Hi [Vendor],

I run WeddingCounselors.com - a free directory helping engaged
couples find premarital counseling.

Would you be open to mentioning it to couples you work with?
Many couples don't know where to find premarital counseling,
and this helps them find local, qualified therapists.

In return, I'm happy to:
- List you as a recommended wedding vendor (free)
- Link to your site from our resources page
- Give you flyers to hand out (I'll design them free)

Let me know if you're interested!
```

**Why This Works:**
- Mutually beneficial
- They're already talking to engaged couples
- Positions you as a helpful resource
- Builds partnerships, not sales

### Subreddits to Post In:
- r/therapists
- r/psychotherapy
- r/marriagetherapy
- r/weddingplanning (help couples find counseling)
- Local city subreddits (r/Louisville, etc.)

### Post Template:
```
[For therapist subreddits]

Subject: Spent 15 minutes improving your WeddingCounselors listing

Hi [Name],

I run WeddingCounselors.com (free directory for premarital counselors).

I just spent some time creating a really nice profile for your practice:
[PROFILE_URL]

I pulled info from your website to make it complete. Couples
searching Google for "premarital counseling [city]" are finding
counselors through the directory.

You can claim this listing for free to:
- Get email alerts when couples contact you
- Make any edits you'd like
- See your lead stats

No cost, just trying to help connect couples with quality counselors.

Claim here: [CLAIM_URL]
Or let me know if you'd prefer I remove it.

Best,
[Name]
```

**Why This CRUSHES:**
- You've already given them 15 minutes of your time
- Their profile looks great (not bare bones)
- They feel grateful, not sold to
- Social proof (it's already built)
- Reciprocity effect (they'll likely claim it)

But for now? **Use FREE methods.** They work better anyway because they're personal.

- 10 perfect profiles that counselors WANT to claim
- Better than 100 crappy ones they ignore

**2. Make Their Life Easier**
- Pre-fill as much as possible
- Make claiming literally 2 clicks
- Don't ask for info you can Google

**3. Show Social Proof**
- "Join 50+ counselors already listed"
- "200+ couples searched last month"
- "Average counselor gets 3-5 inquiries/month"

**4. Be Personal**
- Mention something specific about their practice
- Comment on their website or GMB reviews
- Show you actually looked at their work

**5. Follow Up (Not Too Much)**
- Email 1: Initial value offer
- Email 2 (7 days later): "Just checking if you got my last email"
- Email 3 (14 days later): "Should I remove your listing?"
- STOP if no response (don't be annoying)

---

## ✅ Success Metrics

**Good Results (Month 1):**
- 10-15 counselors claim profiles
- 5-10 leads sent to counselors
- 2-3 paid upgrades

**Great Results (Month 1):**
- 20-30 counselors claim profiles
- 15-25 leads sent
- 5+ paid upgrades

**How to Get There:**
- Personal outreach (not mass email)
- "Give first" strategy
- Perfect your claim page
- Make claiming EASY and VALUABLE

---

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

❌ Send mass, generic emails
❌ Lie about traffic/leads
❌ Make claiming complicated
❌ Charge before providing value
❌ Spam therapist groups
❌ Use pushy sales language
❌ Give up after 1 email

---

## 💡 Remember

**You don't need money. You need:**
1. Good profiles (give value first)
2. Clear benefit (free leads from couples)
3. Easy process (2-minute claim)
4. Personal touch (LinkedIn, not spam)
5. Persistence (follow up, but don't annoy)

Most SaaS companies get their first 100 users through **manual outreach**.
It's slow, but it works. And it's free.

**Start with 10 counselors. Perfect the process. Then scale.**

Good luck! 🎉
