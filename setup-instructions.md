## 🎯 Your Value Proposition

**What you're offering counselors:**
1. **Free directory listing** (no cost, no contracts)
2. **Professional profile** with bio and services
3. **SEO backlink** to their website (valuable!)
4. **Increased referrals** from couples searching online
5. **No ongoing maintenance** required

**Why this works:**
- Many counselors have poor online visibility
- Directory listings improve local SEO
- Backlinks are genuinely valuable
- Free = no risk for them to try
