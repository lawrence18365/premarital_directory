-- Post 1: Fighting About Wedding Planning
UPDATE posts
SET content = '''It was supposed to be the happiest time of your life, but lately, every conversation about the wedding ends in an argument. Sound familiar? You''re not alone. Wedding planning is one of the first major projects you''ll tackle as a team, and it comes with a unique set of pressures that can lead to stress and conflict.\n\nFrom the budget and the guest list to differing opinions from family, it''s easy to feel like you''re on opposite sides. But these challenges don''t have to drive you apart. In fact, learning to navigate them together can make your relationship stronger than ever. Here''s how to stop fighting about wedding planning and start feeling like a team again.\n\n### 1. Acknowledge That It''s Stressful\nFirst, give yourselves some grace. You''re planning a huge event, managing a budget, and juggling family expectations—all while preparing for a lifelong commitment. It''s okay to feel stressed. Acknowledge the pressure you''re both under and validate each other''s feelings. Sometimes just saying, "I know this is a lot right now, and I''m feeling it too," can make a world of difference.\n\n### 2. Schedule Regular, Low-Pressure Planning Meetings\nDon''t let wedding talk bleed into every moment of your life. Set aside specific, dedicated times to discuss planning. This prevents conversations from popping up when one of you is tired or distracted. Keep these meetings focused and try to end them on a positive note, even if it''s just deciding on something small. And most importantly, make sure you still have date nights and other activities where wedding talk is completely off-limits.\n\n### 3. Divide and Conquer (But Stay Informed)\nPlay to your strengths. If one of you is a spreadsheet wizard, let them take the lead on the budget. A great place to start is by asking the **[10 Financial Questions Every Couple Must Ask Before Getting Married](/blog/financial-questions-to-ask-before-marriage)**. If the other has a great eye for design, they can handle the creative details. Delegate tasks based on interest and skill, but agree to keep each other in the loop with a brief weekly update.\n\n### 4. Create a United Front with Family\nFamily input is one of the biggest sources of wedding planning conflict. Well-meaning parents or opinionated siblings can easily put you and your partner in a difficult position. It is crucial that you and your partner present a united front. We highly recommend reading our guide on **[setting healthy boundaries with in-laws](/blog/setting-healthy-boundaries-with-inlaws)** to get on the same page first. Then, communicate your decisions to your families as a team.\n\n### 5. The Budget is a Promise, Not a Suggestion\nMoney is a huge source of arguments. Before you book a single vendor, you need to agree on a realistic budget. This number should be based on what you can comfortably afford, not what you feel pressured to spend. Once you''ve set the budget, treat it as a firm agreement. This will make decisions easier down the line, as you can always ask, "Does this fit within the budget we promised each other?"\n\n### 6. Practice Active Listening\nWhen you do disagree, the goal isn''t to "win" the argument; it''s to understand your partner''s perspective. Put down your phones, make eye contact, and truly listen to what the other person is saying. Repeat back what you heard ("So, it sounds like you''re worried about..." or "What I''m hearing is that you feel...") to ensure you understand before you respond. Feeling heard is often half the battle.\n\n---\n\n#### This is Practice for Your Marriage\nRemember, how you handle wedding planning stress is a preview of how you''ll handle future life challenges. Use this as an opportunity to build the communication skills that will serve you for a lifetime.\n\nIf you''re finding it difficult to get on the same page, a premarital counselor can be an invaluable resource. They can act as a neutral third party to help you work through disagreements and strengthen your partnership.\n\n**[Browse our directory to find a qualified premarital counselor near you.](/states)**'''

-- Post 2: Love, Honor, and... Boundaries
UPDATE posts
SET content = '''When you get married, you aren''t just gaining a spouse; you''re merging with an entire family, complete with its own traditions, expectations, and ways of communicating. It''s a beautiful process, but it can also be one of the most challenging aspects of newly married life. One of the most crucial skills you can develop as a couple is the ability to set healthy boundaries.\n\nMany couples think of boundaries as negative or confrontational, but that couldn''t be further from the truth. Healthy boundaries are not about shutting people out. They are about creating a respectful and sustainable structure for your relationships to thrive. Setting boundaries is a loving act for your marriage and, in the long run, for your extended family. Here''s how to get started.\n\n### Step 1: Define Your Boundaries as a Couple (In Private)\nBefore you can communicate your boundaries, you have to know what they are. This conversation should happen in private, just between you and your partner. This is your chance to get on the same page and form a united front. If you find that you''re **[fighting about wedding planning](/blog/fighting-about-wedding-planning)**, it''s often because you haven''t aligned on these core boundaries yet. Discuss specific, practical topics:\n\n- **Visits:** How often are we comfortable with family visiting? Do we want them to call before they come over, or is an unannounced drop-in okay?\n- **Finances:** Are we comfortable accepting financial gifts? Will we share details about our income or debts with our parents? For more on this, see our guide to the **[10 financial questions to ask before marriage](/blog/financial-questions-to-ask-before-marriage)**.\n- **Holidays:** How will we split time between families? Which traditions do we want to keep, and which new ones do we want to start for our own family?\n- **Advice:** How will we handle unsolicited advice on topics like our careers, where we live, or how we decorate our home?\n\n### Step 2: Always Communicate as a Team\nThis is the golden rule of boundaries. You must be a united front. When communicating a boundary to family, it should come from both of you. Use "we" statements to reinforce that this is a decision you''ve made together as a new family unit.\n\n- **Instead of:** "My wife doesn''t want us to come for dinner this Sunday."\n- **Try:** "We''re going to have a quiet weekend at home this Sunday, but we''d love to see you next week."\n\nThis prevents one partner from being seen as the "bad guy" and shows that you are making decisions as a team.\n### Step 3: Be Clear, Kind, and Firm\nYou don''t need to be harsh, but you do need to be clear. Vague boundaries are confusing and easily crossed. At the same time, delivering the message with kindness can prevent hurt feelings.\n\n- **Vague and Unhelpful:** "We just need a little more space."\n- **Clear, Kind, and Firm:** "We love having you over, but we''ve decided to keep Sunday afternoons just for us to recharge before the work week. Can we plan on dinner Tuesday instead?"\n\nRemember, you don''t need to over-explain or justify your decision. "Because it''s what works for us as a couple" is a complete and valid reason.\n\n### Step 4: Expect to Be Tested (and Hold Firm)\nSetting a new boundary can be a change for everyone, and it''s normal for it to be tested—often unintentionally. Your family is used to interacting with you in a certain way, and it can take time for them to adjust. If a boundary is crossed, it''s important to address it calmly and consistently.\n\nFor example, if a family member drops by unannounced after you''ve asked them to call first, you could say: "It''s so good to see you! We''re actually in the middle of something right now, which is why we asked that people call before coming over. We can''t chat long today, but are you free on Thursday? We''d love to have you then."\n\nThis reinforces the boundary respectfully without creating a major conflict.\n\n---\n\n#### Boundaries are the Foundation for a Lifetime of Healthy Relationships\nLearning to set and maintain boundaries is a skill that will serve your marriage for decades to come. It reduces conflict, builds trust between you and your partner, and ultimately allows you to have a more authentic and respectful relationship with your in-laws.\n\nIf these conversations feel difficult or you''re struggling to get on the same page, a premarital counselor can be an invaluable resource. They can provide a neutral space and proven tools to help you and your partner work as a team.\n\n**[Browse our directory to find a qualified premarital counselor near you.](/states)**'''

-- Post 3: Financial Questions
UPDATE posts
SET content = '''Planning a wedding is an exciting time, filled with decisions about venues, flowers, and guest lists. But one of the most important conversations you can have before you walk down the aisle has nothing to do with the wedding day itself—it''s about your financial future together. Money is one of the top sources of conflict in a marriage. Getting on the same page about your finances before you say "I do" is one of the most important investments you can make in your relationship.\n\nSitting down to have an open and honest conversation about money can feel intimidating, but it''s a crucial step in building a strong foundation of trust and teamwork. To help you get started, here are 10 essential financial questions every couple should discuss before getting married.\n\n### 1. What is our current financial situation?\nThis is the big one. It''s time for full transparency. This means sharing everything: your income, your debts (student loans, credit card debt, car loans, etc.), your savings, and your investments. It might feel uncomfortable, but you can''t make a shared plan without knowing your starting point. Use this as an opportunity to be a team, not to judge.\n\n### 2. Are we savers or spenders?\nUnderstanding each other''s natural money personality is key. Is one of you a natural saver who clips coupons and loves a good deal, while the other enjoys spending freely? Neither is inherently "right" or "wrong," but you need to understand your different approaches to money so you can find a balance that works for both of you.\n\n### 3. Should we combine our bank accounts?\nThere are a few common approaches here:\n- **Completely Combined:** All money goes into one joint account, and all bills are paid from it.\n- **Completely Separate:** You maintain your own individual accounts and split shared bills.\n- **A Hybrid Approach:** You have a joint account for shared household expenses (like rent and groceries) but keep separate individual accounts for personal spending.\n\nThere''s no one-size-fits-all answer. Discuss the pros and cons of each and decide what feels most comfortable for your relationship.\n\n### 4. What are our long-term financial goals?\nAre you dreaming of buying a house in five years? Do you want to travel the world? Retire early? Talk about your big-picture dreams and start thinking about how you can work towards them together. This conversation can be a lot of fun, as it helps you align your financial habits with your shared life goals.\n\n### 5. How will we handle big purchases?\nIt''s a good idea to set a "discussion threshold" for purchases. For example, you might agree that any purchase over $200 needs to be discussed and agreed upon by both of you. This simple rule can prevent a lot of arguments and ensure you''re both on the same page about where your money is going.\n\n### 6. Who will be responsible for managing the day-to-day finances?\nOne person may be more organized or simply enjoy managing the budget more than the other. It''s perfectly fine for one person to take the lead on paying bills and tracking expenses, as long as both partners have full visibility and are involved in the bigger financial decisions. The key is that this responsibility is delegated, not abdicated.\n\n### 7. How do we feel about debt?\nYour "debt philosophy" is incredibly important. Is your goal to be completely debt-free as soon as possible, or are you comfortable with certain types of "good debt," like a mortgage? If one of you has significant debt coming into the marriage, you need to have a clear plan for how you will tackle it together.\n\n### 8. What is our financial plan for starting a family?\nIf you plan on having children, the financial implications are significant. This is often a source of conflict, so it''s important to read up on how to **[stop fighting about wedding planning](/blog/fighting-about-wedding-planning)** and other major life events. Discuss how you will handle the costs of childcare, education, and all the other expenses that come with raising a family.\n\n### 9. How much do we want to save for retirement?\nRetirement might feel like a long way off, but the earlier you start saving, the better. Discuss your retirement goals and make a plan to contribute to your retirement accounts consistently. Understanding your partner''s expectations for retirement is a key part of planning your life together.\n\n### 10. How can we continue to have healthy conversations about money?\nThis isn''t a one-time conversation. It''s a commitment to ongoing communication. Agree to have regular "money dates"—perhaps once a month—to check in on your budget, review your goals, and discuss any financial issues that have come up. This makes talking about money a normal and healthy part of your relationship, not a source of stress.\n---\n\n#### Ready to Build a Stronger Foundation?\nHaving these conversations can be challenging, but you don''t have to do it alone. A premarital counselor can provide a safe and structured environment to help you navigate these important topics and develop healthy communication habits that will last a lifetime.\n\n**[Browse our directory to find a qualified premarital counselor near you.](/states)**'''
